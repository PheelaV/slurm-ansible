# SECURITY WARNING

This repository includes a demonstration of using SSH keys for Ansible Vault password management.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ⚠️

1. The included key in `keys/id_ed25519_ansible_vault` is for **DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY**
2. In a production environment:
   - **NEVER** commit SSH keys to a repository
   - Use proper key management solutions
   - Consider HashiCorp Vault or similar for sensitive credential storage
   - Implement proper key rotation policies

3. This simplified approach prioritizes learning over security best practices.

## Production Migration Steps

When transitioning to production:

1. Delete the demonstration key
2. Generate new secure credentials
3. Set up proper key management
4. Use interactive vault password or integrate with a secure key management service
